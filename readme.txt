== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin send my data somewhere? =

We don't send any of your private data to anyone.
But please note that we do make requests to the Push Response server. When you add a Push Response list (banner) ID via plugin, we send that ID to our servers to get your banner data (title, description, icon etc). This data is not private and you don't have to be afraid that someone can intercept it.
